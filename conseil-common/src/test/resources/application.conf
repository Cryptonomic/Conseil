#
# Slick loads the configuration using Typesafe Config in 'slick.util.GlobalConfig'.
# Since we want to make "application.conf" required in any internal and external configuration,
# we need to provide placeholder here, so keyword `required` can be used in custom configurations.
#
# Note that this file is required only for testing non-runnable modules - runnable modules contains all required files.
# This placeholder is needed as long as 'slick.util.GlobalConfig' won't be changed or '.delete' operation won't required that.
